/*
 * Java design patterns are standard solutions to common software design problems.
 * They help developers write code that is more maintainable, reusable, and scalable.
 *
 * Design patterns are broadly categorized into 3 main types:
 *
 * 1. Creational Design Patterns
 *    - Deal with 'object creation mechanisms', trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.
 * 2. Structural Design Patterns
 *    - Deal with 'object composition'—how objects are structured to form larger systems.
 * 3. Behavioral Design Patterns
 *    - Deal with 'communication between objects'—how they interact and distribute responsibility.
 *
 * | Type           | Purpose                       | Example Patterns            |
 * | -------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |
 * | Creational     | Object creation logic         | Singleton, Factory, Builder |
 * | Structural     | Class/object composition      | Adapter, Decorator, Facade  |
 * | Behavioral     | Communication between objects | Observer, Strategy, Command |
