/*
 * What is the Facade Design Pattern?
 * The Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
 *
 * ðŸ“Œ Use Cases in the Real World (Enterprise Grade):
 *   - Wrapping multiple microservices behind a unified gateway (like API Gateway).
 *   - Simplifying complex business logic across services/modules in a Service Layer.
 *   - Providing a unified interface for various subsystems (e.g., Payment, Notification, Order).
 *
 * ðŸ§  Summary
 * The Facade Pattern helps:
 *   - Abstract away internal service complexities.
 *   - Improve maintainability.
 *   - Make it easier for frontend/mobile/microservices to call a single unified method.
 *
 * In a Spring Boot microservices architecture, this pattern maps closely to API Gateway.
