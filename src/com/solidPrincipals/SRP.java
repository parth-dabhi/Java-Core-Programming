/*
 * Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
 *
 * 1. Introduction
 * The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is the first of the SOLID principles.
 * It states:
 *   A class should do only one thing and do it well.
 * If a class has more than one responsibility, it becomes harder to maintain, test, and extend.
 * If you put multiple concerns in one class (e.g., business logic + database code + logging),
 * changing one thing might break others.
 *
 * Analogy
 * Think of a restaurant:
 *   - Chef cooks food üç≤
 *   - Waiter serves food üçΩÔ∏è
 *   - Cashier handles payments üí∞
 *
 * If one person does all three, service becomes slow and mistakes happen.
 * Similarly, in programming, each class should do one job.
 *
 * Summary
 * Definition: A class should have only one reason to change.
 * Why: Improves maintainability, reduces bugs, makes testing easier.
 * How: Keep classes focused on one responsibility, and delegate other concerns.
 * In Practice: Split data, persistence, and presentation into separate classes.

//    }
//
//    public double getTotalAmount() {
